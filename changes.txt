changes.txt file for bm2html.pl by Herb Wolfe

8/5/2000 
	Found and fixed bug with -y (and possibly -d) options where the files
weren't being place in their subdirectory.

	Put in -x option. (Actually did this a couple days previous) for use on
dos/windows files. Idea suggested by Dan Thatcher. (thanks)

	Replaced multiple print statements with one line, however, this causes
problems with spacing. May change back to using vars as tested earlier.

8/6/2000
	Changed some print statements to printf's to try and fix spacing

8/14/2000
	Added username var to put in title
	Changed colors to my preferences, commenting out defaults I had created

8/24/2000
	Fixed another bug with -y option, related to the previous one.

11/03/2001
	Added option to use stylesheet

1/27/2002
	Added code to remove Netscape's comments

09/2003
	Made minor code optimizations
	Returned color settings to defaults, since I use stylesheets
	Stylesheet var now set to location of stylesheet in command line
	Changed code for printing footer. Footer now read into array and
	printed when needed 

10/2005
	Took out the align=center attribute from the <h1> tag used to display
	the page title.
